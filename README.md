# Rock Paper Scissors 

For this exercise we had to recreate the classic child game Rock Paper Scissors (altough everyone knows it's actually Scissors Rock Paper). 


## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives 
- Select a random element
- Conditional statements (if)


## ðŸ”§ Tools used 
- Visual Studio Code(HTML, CSS, JS)
- Markdown
- Google, our best friend
- Flaticon.com, for icons


## âœ¨ Must Have Features 
- Show a play again button after a game ended
- Nice graphics
- Different end message styling depending on the outcome (hint: you might need to add or remove classes via JavaScript for this)
- If you want, you can add a fun factor by changing the three choices
- Clean your code
  * Delete unused code or out of date comments
  * Try to write hard to understand parts in a way that's easier to understand for other developers
  * Can you use functions to make your code easier to read or reuse?
  
  
  ## ðŸ‘€ Result 
  ### - [Rock Paper Scissors](https://maureenoldyck.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/ "Rock Paper Scissors")
